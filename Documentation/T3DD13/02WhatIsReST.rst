What is ReST?
==========================================

- ReST stands for "ReStructuredText". It is the name of a text **markup
  syntax**.
  It has nothing to do with restful services known as "REST".

- It has been developed around the year 2000 by David Goodger and it is
  stable.

- It is "an easy-to-read, what-you-see-is-what-you-get 
  plaintext markup syntax and parser system."
  `(David Goodger) <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/introduction.html>`__
  
- It is widespread and used all over the world. So we are part of a big
  and growing community of ReST users.
