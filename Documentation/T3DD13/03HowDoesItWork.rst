How does it work?
==========================================

- You write documentation much like you're used to writing other **code**.

- You can use the same text editing tools that you elsewhere use for coding
  (like PhpStorm, Vi, Vim, Gedit, Notepad++).
  
- You're writing plain text much like there used to be typewriter
  text in former times.
  
- Use UTF-8 to encode Non-Ascii characters. There is no other "special
  encoding" for characters.
  
- If your text editor allows it and you know what it is it's a good idea to use 
  UTF-8 files **with** byte order mark (BOM).
  
- You can use any line end character like LF, CR, CRLF.

- ... and stick to the **rules of ReST markup**.
