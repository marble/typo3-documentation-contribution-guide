What are we going to do?
==========================================

The plan is to

- start with a short introduction
- get into contact
- try to give everybody a lift so that he can really start
- repeat that every hour
- spend the remaining part of the hour with practically "Getting started"

I want to learn from the audience to make this a better "TYPO3 
Documentation Contribution Guide".

If you have more time you're welcome to stay here and help with some of
our manuals.
