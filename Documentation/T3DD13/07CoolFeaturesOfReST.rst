Cool features of ReST
==========================================

- you can nest all elements to almost any level

- it provides strict checking

- ReST source is parsed and transformed into a well
  defined internal tree structure
  
- many tools are available to produce output in different
  forms from that internal representation  

- **Fixed:** The markup is fixed and will not change!

  *Well*, every now and then there may be a new markup
  become implemented. But it will be backwards compatible
  with existing sources.
  
- But **extendable:** There are two means by which functionality
  can be added: text roles and directives.
