=====================================
It's good to know these names
=====================================

`Docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`__
is the name of the basic Python documentation package. 
It contains the one and only ReST parser and the basic transformation
and output tools. With the Docutils you handle one file at a time.
  
`Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`__ builds on the Docutils. It handles a bunch of ReST files
and treats them as a documentation project. We want Sphinx!

`RestTools <https://git.typo3.org/Documentation/RestTools.git>`__
is a Git repository with ReST specific stuff specially for the 
TYPO3 community.

`t3sphinx <https://git.typo3.org/Documentation/RestTools.git/tree/HEAD:/ExtendingSphinxForTYPO3/src/t3sphinx>`__
is a Python package that provides TYPO3 specific features
if you do rendering locally.
