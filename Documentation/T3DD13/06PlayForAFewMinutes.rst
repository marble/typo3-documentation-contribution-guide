**RSTED**
    is a cool online tool. It's been written by 
    `Andrey Rublev <https://github.com/anru>`__
    and kept online at http://rst.ninjs.org/ 
    Thank you for that!

At **docs.typo3.org**
    we have an experimental version of **RSTED** as well.
    
    http://docs.typo3.org/:5000
    
    But every once in a while it crashes and may not be
    available.

    **Advantage:** I you choose the "Nature" theme of that instance
    it has a bit of TYPO3 colors.    

.. For insiders: How to restart the service:
        mbless@srv123: cd ~/rst-ninjs-org/rsted
        mbless@srv123: cat README.rst
        mbless@srv123: python application.py
        start http://docs.typo3.org:5000/
