Q: No highlighting for TypoScript?
   2013-03-25

   "I have TypoScript in a codeblock and I'm indicating it with 
   ``.. code-block:: ts``. But it doesn't work. Why?" 

   A: Sorry, unfortunately Pygments, which is the syntax highlighter
   that's being used by Sphinx, doesn't know TypoScript yet.
   We need a volunteer to add the necessary `lexer and rules <http://pygments.org/languages/>`_.
